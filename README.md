# Sequence
This repository contains documentation and an interpreter for the Turing-complete esoteric programming language "Sequence."

If you are unfamiliar with the language (as most should be, considering I invented it) then a good place to start would be with the [Sequence Documentation](https://github.com/KeithMMeyer/Sequence/blob/master/Sequence%20Documentation.md). If you'd like to test your written code, you can run it using the included Java interpreter. An easier to use command-based version of the interpreter is in the works, check back soon for updates.
